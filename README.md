# Hera-Docs

Hera is a Titano fork, which is an auto-rebase token that provides staking rewards just for holding the tokens in your wallet. Rewards are credited to each token holder through a rebase mechanism that essentially expands the total supply of the token on a regular schedule. The expansion of the token is backed by fees that are paid when the token is bought or sold on an exchange.

As an inmprovement apon Titano's smart contract Hera aims to provide additional features that will help stabilize the inflation of the token as well as provide more value for the Hera Token community.
