Features:
As a developer-based community centric project, Hera is focused on innovation that creates benefits and value for Hera token holders. Our HAP and DRS protocols used in the Hera token give it an exceptional edge against our competitors making Hera a very attractive investment vehicle. 
HAP gives the Hera token automatic staking and compounding features, as well as one of the highest Fixed APY in the market of 102,483.58%, a daily ROI (Return on Investment) of 1.89999%. 

The Dividend Rewards System (DRS) pays a portion of the trading fees to token holders in BUSD. This guarantees additional payouts to our token holders in the form of a relatively stable currency.

Benefits of $ERA:
•	Easy and Safe – We provide auto-staking right in your wallet when you purchase $ERA. No need to move your tokens to our website. From the minute you buy. You are staked and set to receive rebase rewards. The easiest auto-staking in DeFi.
•	A fixed APY – APYs that fluctuate means you can never tell how many tokens you will receive. Other DeFi protocols pay out a high APY that can fluctuate by 90% in a day. HAP pays $ERA holders a fixed interest rate of 1.8999% daily or with compounding 102,483.58% annually, that tops the industry.
•	Fast Rebase Rewards - Other popular staking protocols pay rebasing rewards every 8 hours which means if you want to unstake, you must time it to get maximum rewards. The Hera Auto-staking Protocol pays every 30 minutes or 48 times every day, making it one of the fastest auto-staking protocols in crypto.
•	BUSD Rewards – Holding the $ERA token makes you a share holder in our dividends reward program which entitles you to a portion of our monthly dividend payouts. These dividends are distributed in BUSD, a stable coin that allows you to maintain your value despite market movements. 

Our HAP and DRS protocols use a complex set of factors to support the price of $ERA and the rebase rewards. They incorporate game theory and human nature to determine the most likely habits of those who buy the token. Our development team has coordinated all these elements, so they work seamlessly behind the scenes. The result is a simple and elegant staking and rewards system for $ERA holders. 

The $ERA token is as flexible as it is powerful and will be used as the foundation for a range of Hera products, services, and projects going forward. Each will transform a different area of crypto.
